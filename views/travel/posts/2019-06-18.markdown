# Week 1: France ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·

When I started writing this post, I was heading off to Geneva, at around 1am in a bus, so whatever I wrote was garbage. Here I am rewriting it a few weeks later ðŸ˜…

So... I spent 6 days in France. Itâ€™s hard to believe it went by so fast. I landed in Paris, visited a few monuments: Palais Garnier, le Louvre, musÃ©e dâ€™Orsay (to see the Van Gogh paintings that Iâ€™d missed the previous year, only to find out that the exposition was closed...  so I meandered through the neo-expressionism exposition; I walked A LOT, and chilled in le Jardin des Tuileries.
I also spent a day in Chartres, which had an amazing light show projected on its cathedral, a day in ChÃ¢teaudun, and another in Blois. Blois was a cute little city, which I used as a layover for a day trip to the ChÃ¢teau de Chambord, which was amazing.

As it wasnâ€™t high season yet, and I was visiting small towns, the hostels had only one or two other guests other than myself... which contributed to a general sense of loneliness during that first week. I did meet some kind people along the way: two Canadians, whom I bumped into again by pure luck the next day, spent a great evening visiting Blois with my ridesharing driver, and shared a ðŸ‘Œ conversation with my ridesharing driver on the way back to Paris.

As you might have noticed, I already posted the pictures, as that requires little to no effort on my part ðŸ˜†
