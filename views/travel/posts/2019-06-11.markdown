# Goodbyes and departure... 🤦🏻‍♂️

In the last 10 days, I’ve *finally* finished with my masters: submitted a paper for publication at a conference and applied for graduation. It feels amazing to have finished, yet it oddly felt anticlimactic. Whatever, “I’m On Va-Ca-Tion” !!

Another task, also *finally*, accomplished was packing my bag and planning an itinerary for what was to be the first week of my trip in 🇩🇪...

If you went back to reread that last sentence, you read that right. I missed my flight. 😖
I should have arrived a bit earlier, but would have made the flight had the company not (probably) given my ticket away, and more importantly had the plane not left early. Thanks a lot WestJet! 😑

I’m really glad my parents were there in my time of need. 👪 You two are amazing! 🥰😘

Shit happens, but adventure still awaits. I’m now leaving on the 12th, as opposed to the 11th. I’m taking a bus to Montreal, then flying to Paris. Tomorrow will be a long day, as I try to plan about a week in France. I think I’ll check out some castles, just in a different country than I had originally planned.

I’ve said my goodbyes to my friends and family. Although it’s more of a see you later. I’ll miss you all, buuuut I’ll also be busy having fun. Sorry, not sorry 😅🤪🤗
