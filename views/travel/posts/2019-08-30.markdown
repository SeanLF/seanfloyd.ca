# France 🇫🇷 & Monaco 🇲🇨

This is my third flight to France in three months. This time I flew in to visit family as they were vacationing in the French Riviera.

Flying to Nice, I got to see the danish islands, the Swiss mountains, the Italian lakes, the French alps and even Sicily! A nice partial recap of my trip so far 😛 As soon as I entered the arrival hall, I realized quickly that I was completely surrounded by blonds arriving from both Denmark and Sweden or Norway. And to my great pleasure, Prescilia and Franck were waiting for me to give me a ride to the villa that the family had rented up in the mountains. As soon as I arrived, enthusiastic bises to everyone. It was really wonderful seeing everyone again 😊 we chilled by the pool that afternoon and evening

The following day, I visited Cannes with Sophie, Nathalie & Didier. Overall, it was a rich town, without much character and no gastronomic specialty. The steps for the Festival de Cannes were lacklustre without all of the usual pizzazz. Vieux (old) Cannes was much more pleasant with its typical pastel coloured facades and painted shutters. We then met up with the rest of the family for an evening market visit on the waterfront.

Next day: Monaco. We walked down from the Monte Carlo Casino down to the beach, meandering through the Japanese Gardens on the way. I had a delicious Thai steak salad. With Prescilia, Yohan and Maelya, we took a quick stroll on top of Le Rocher (where the Palais Princier and the Musée Océanographique are located). That evening, I was treated to a delicious meal comprising of at least half a kilogram of meat 🤤

The next day was a chill pool day, played pétanques, and took a big family group photo 😃 Finished the day with a pyrotechnic show in Cannes. The theme was the man with the iron mask, but we couldn’t really figure out how the fireworks tied to the theme. Visually interesting though 😊

Next destination: Antibes. It was really pretty, but I couldn’t see myself living there. Way too small but the old city was really cute. I first went for a stroll by myself around town and then joined Nathalie for a dip in the sea.

We went back to Monaco the following day. I visited the Palais Princier which was unfortunately under renovation and we were forbidden to take pictures while inside. The palace was neat, but wasn’t as extravagant as the picture suggested or my imagination hoped for. I then quickly walked through the Musée Océanographique where I saw some cool jellyfish, seahorses and sea turtles. That night I got pretty tipsy 🙈 and partied with my cousins until the wee hours (3 or 4 in the morning). That night I was particularly into Brazilian music.

My last day with the family was chill, and we went to the beach at Villefranche-sur-Mer. It looked a bit touristy but the buildings reminded me of the Cinque Terre region in Italy. Very beautiful.

I then spent a few days in Marseille visiting another cousin and her daughter, both of whom I hadn’t seen since 2010. I had such an amazing time with them, as short as it was. ❤️

I then flew out to visit Sandrine in Geneva for her birthday ❤️🥳
