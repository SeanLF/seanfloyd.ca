# Second timeâ€™s the charm ðŸ˜…

As you can tell by the title, I made it!

It wasnâ€™t without a few hiccups again this time, but not enough to stop me from leaving! I had a first scare at checkin, as it wouldnâ€™t let me. After calling Air Canada, I was told Iâ€™d have to show my credit card at the airport, for fraud-prevention, since Iâ€™d bought my ticket less than 24 hours before the flight...
And lastly, now that Iâ€™m finally in the plane, it needs to be repaired. It's a small delay, in the grand scheme of things: 40 minutes. I shouldn't complain as it gives me enough time to write this post.

Itâ€™s crazy to think that Iâ€™m flying off to ~~Frankfurt~~ Paris... Iâ€™ve been dreaming of this vacation for so long, that now that itâ€™s really happening, it feels like just another day. To my friends that teased me about never actually finishing, I tell you this: thanks for giving me the motivation to prove you wrong! ðŸ˜œ

Well, Iâ€™m taking off any minute now. Catch yâ€™all later!
